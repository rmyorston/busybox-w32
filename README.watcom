An experimental compilation of busybox-win32 for the NT/Win32 target using Open Watcom (v2).

The first aim is to be able to cross-compile from Linux to Windows (avoiding having to port 
the kconfig system).

To build, make a build directory and cd to it
from within the build directory, do :

make -f ${path_to_busybox-w32_sources}/Makefile watcom386_defconfig 

an out-of-source build is preferrable since it will not pollute the source tree

When busybox-win32 successully builds on Linux, the next aim will be to build it natively
on Windows (preferably without any *nix environment stuff)

Expected dependencies for native compilation on Windows:
shell? Perhaps not if possible to avoid, we will stick to the stock "cmd"
gmake: wmake can not handle the Makefiles in busybox.
pdcurses-win32a : especially for "make menuconfig"
