An experimental compilation of busybox for the NT/Win32 and Linux target using Open Watcom (v2).
The Win32 port makes heavy use of the MinGW port's compatibility changes.

http://open-watcom.github.io/open-watcom/

*Make dependencies:*

minimal version of Open Watcom: v2 
The build has been tested on Open Watcom v2 commit: 0.r2482.g7a44a32 (31 January, 2015)
this or later should work.

On a linux host:
GNU make is needed

On a Windows host (not entirely ready. Watcom as HOSTCC needs to be resolved)
GNU make is needed
KBuild depends on some UNIX utilities (sed, ...)
- GNUWin32 or Busybox-w32 should provide the needed functions.


* Out-of-tree build *
It is recommended to build outside of the source tree. To do so, make and cd to a build directory and

On Linux:

KBUILD_SRC=${source_path} make -f ${source_path}/Makefile watcom${arch}_${target}_defconfig

On Windows:
In Powershell

sv KBUILD_SRC ${source_path}
make -f $KBUILD_SRC\Makefile watcom${arch}_${target}_defconfig


source_path is the path to the busybox-w32 source code
arch can be: 386
target can be: win32, linux
