# It's debatable what is the correct value above.
# Does 'return' in trap see $? == 2 or $? == 3?
# IOW: after (kill..), does shell first wait for its completion
# and sets $?, then checks pending signals and runs a trap handler,
# or does it first check pending signals and runs handler?
# hush does the former, and prints 3.
