# Surprisingly, bash does not handle comments in $()
# the same way as in ``. "#" causes the rest of the line, _including_ )",
# to be ignored. These lines would cause an error:
#echo "$(echo Ok3 #comment is ignored)"
#echo $(echo Ok4 #comment is ignored)
#
echo "$(echo Ok5 #comment is ignored
)"
echo $(echo Ok6 #comment is ignored
)
